</a>

The following explains how to use the statistics table:

*Monitor apps in realtime* _The table supports realtime monitoring by displaying statistics for the last hour and minute, enabling you to identify and respond to issues quickly._

*Track usage* _Monitor the number of messages published and received, presence events, and data transferred. This helps you understand your app's usage patterns._

*Analyze performance* _View key performance indicators, such as peak connections and channels. These insights help you gauge your app's capacity and performance over time._

*Analyze trends* _Compare data across different periods (e.g. last month vs. this month) to identify trends, spikes, and periods of low usage. Use this information to make informed decisions about resource allocation and scaling._

*Track events* _Track specific events, such as webhook executions, queue operations, and push notifications, to understand better and debug your app's functionalities._

*Plan* _Use insights into peak usage times and data transfer volumes to plan for capacity, ensuring your app can handle expected loads without performance issues._

*Forecast* _Review forecast data to anticipate future usage, helping you optimize server resources and improve the user experience._

*Download insights* _Download or view detailed app statistics for a more granular analysis, enabling deeper dives into specific metrics as needed._

*Generate summary reports* _Generate concise summary reports of key metrics to communicate app performance and usage statistics to stakeholders._

h2(#chart). Statistics chart

The Stats page also includes a chart that visualizes your app's data over time:

  <img src="@content/screenshots/dash/stats-chart.png" style="width: 100%" alt="Your stats chart">
</a>

The following explains how to use the statistics chart:

*Duration* _Define a specific time range for the statistics you want to view. This enables you to focus on periods of particular interest. For example, set the time range from "2024-06-17 00:00" to "2024-08-06 11:18" to analyze data within that period._

*Zoom* _Use preset zoom options (1h, 8h, 24h, 7d, 1m, 6m, 1y, all) to adjust the chart's view to different periods, enabling you to analyze data at various granularities._
